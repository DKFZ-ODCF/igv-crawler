# EXAMPLE SETTINGS FOR IGVCRAWLER
#
# In this file, we hold all the site/server-specific settings for
# an IGV crawler server, i.e. things that are the same for all projects
# hosted on this server, i.e. those settings that interact with the 
# web-hosting software, not the project data to visualise.


# the local filesystem directory configured as the www document root
#   (NB: this dir MUST NOT have trailing slash!)
# The IGV-crawler will create subdirs in it named `lc $project_name`
host_base_dir: "./www-root"

# the externally visible URL for 'host_base_dir'
#   (NB: MUST NOT have trailing slash)
www_base_url:  "https://localhost/"

# subdirectory name, for both file-system and URL, wherein we store
#   each project's symlinks to the actual data files.
link_dir: "links"

# The filename of the generated project page.
#   We recommend to have the default directory-pagename of the server here, often "index.html".
#   Doing so means that opening a project directory directly opens the crawled, clickable page,
#   instead of a (generated) directory listing, which would leak internal details.
page_name: "index.html"

# Directory where the crawler will write it's crawling reports and statistics
log_dir: "./logs"

# contact email adress printed in the header of each project page.
# recommended to have the server admin, or whoever makes the project configs, here
contact_email: 'admins@example.com'
